[/INST] Answer: \n        While it's true that potatoes are high in carbohydrates, they also provide essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Eating 100 grams of potatoes is a reasonable amount for a healthy diet. However, it's important to balance your potato intake with other nutrient-dense foods to ensure you're meeting your nutritional needs.\n        Consider pairing your potatoes with lean protein sources, vegetables, and whole grains to create a balanced and satisfying meal. Additionally, be mindful of portion sizes and control your overall carbohydrate intake to support weight loss or management.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\n# Define the directory where you want to save the model and tokenizer\nmodel_path = \"/kaggle/working/llama-2-7b-custom\"\n\n# Reload model in FP16 and merge it with LoRA weights\nbase_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,\n    return_dict=True,\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n)  \nmodel = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, new_model)\nmodel = model.merge_and_unload()\n\n# Reload tokenizer to save it\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)\ntokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token\ntokenizer.padding_side = \"right\"\n\n# Create the directory if it doesn't exist\nos.makedirs(model_path, exist_ok=True)\n\n# # Save the merged model and tokenizer to Kaggle's file system\n# model.save_pretrained(model_path)\n# tokenizer.save_pretrained(model_path)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from huggingface_hub import notebook_login\n\nnotebook_login()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model.push_to_hub(\"dilip025/llama-2-7b\")\ntokenizer.push_to_hub(\"dilip025/llama-2-7b\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
